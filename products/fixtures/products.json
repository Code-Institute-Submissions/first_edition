Nietzsche offers instead a new perspective whereby modern persons can assess ethics and the ethical systems that underlie them. At the same time he also accuses prior ethical systems of accepting basic assumptions about morality without rigor, taking them to task for lazy and wishful philosophies. The ideas in Beyond Good and Evil should be examined by anyone who has an interest in ethics, and they are essential reading for those who would learn about meta-ethics. Even when readers may find Nietzsche to be wrong in their estimate, this work still casts light onto areas that seldom otherwise get examined.",

When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, written language or the development among Eurasians of resistance to endemic diseases), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian genomes.",

Dozens of digs in Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon have changed experts' understanding of ancient Israel and its neighbours- as well as their vision of the Bible's greatest tales. Yet until now, the public has remained almost entirely unaware of these discoveries which help separate legend from historical truth. Here, at last, two of archaeology's leading scholars shed new light on how the Bible came into existence. They assert, for example, that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob never existed, that David and Solomon were not great kings but obscure chieftains and that the Exodus never happened. They offer instead a new historical truth: the Bible was created by the people of the small, southern nation of Judah in a heroic last-ditch attempt to keep their faith alive after the demise of the larger, wealthier nation of Israel to the north. It is in this truth, not in the myths of the past, that the real value of the Bible is evident.",

In his longing for truth and liberty, Smith begins a secret love affair with a fellow-worker Julia, but soon discovers the true price of freedom is betrayal.",
